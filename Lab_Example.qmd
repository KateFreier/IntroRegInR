## Question 2

*Create a a scatterplot of vehicle weight and horsepower from the mtcars data frame. Overlay your plot with a median-median line in red.*

```{r}
## this is an example, your code will involve finding the proper
##    slope and intercept, not just putting in two numbers
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$hp, xlab="Weight", ylab="Horsepower")
abline(a=0, b=50, col="red", lwd=3)
```

## Question 3

*Create a scatterplot of vehicle speed and stopping distance from the cars data frame. Overlay your plot with a least-squares regression line in the color of your\
choice.*

```{r}
# and now more code here to complete the graphing task
```

## Question 5

*Fit a least-squares model predicting vehicle hwy_mpg as a function of vehicle weight using the cars04 data frame in the openintro library. Which estimate, d or e, do you feel better about? Why?*

And here you type in your answer to the question...
