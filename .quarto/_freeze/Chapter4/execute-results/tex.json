This is why before even fitting your model you should start with a scatterplot. If your X and Y don't look linearly related in a scatterplot it should be obvious that fitting a line is a bad idea.\n\nBut sometimes departure from linearity is subtle and your initial scatterplot can be misleading. Consider the case of the `forbes` data in the `MASS` library plotted below in @fig-boil. This dataset contains 17 observations exploring the relationship between barometric pressure and the boiling point of water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Barometric pressure and boiling point, fitted](Chapter4_files/figure-pdf/fig-boil-1.pdf){#fig-boil fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fitted regression line looks pretty good at first glance, but let's consider a new plot: the fitted vs. residual diagnostic scatter plot. In @fig-boilplus you can see the original data with the same fitted line as before along with a scatterplot of the model's fitted values plotted against residuals. A red reference line corresponding to a residual equal to 0 is included.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-boilplus .cell layout-ncol=\"2\" layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Fitted Model](Chapter4_files/figure-pdf/fig-boilplus-1.pdf){#fig-boilplus-1 fig-align='center'}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Fitted vs. Residuals](Chapter4_files/figure-pdf/fig-boilplus-2.pdf){#fig-boilplus-2 fig-align='center'}\n:::\n\nBoiling model with residuals\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHmm... the fitted vs. residual plot is a giant arc (with one outlier). From the fitted vs. residual plot it becomes much more clear that as we scan from left to right along the blue fit line our data points begin below the fit line, then there's a string of points above it (with the exception of an oddity at pressure=26.6), and then the last points are below the line again. This means that there is subtle curvature to the relationship between pressure and boiling point.\n\nIdeally your fitted vs. residual plot should be random scatter centered around zero. Without linearity, your line tends to over-estimate Y in some parts of X and under-estimate Y in others. If your linear model error isn't consistent throughout the range of X, the inference methods of Chapter 3 fall apart and aren't valid.\n\n### In R {#Rcode .unnumbered}\n\nCreating the fitted vs. residual diagnostic plot is straight-forward in R and makes use of elements stored in the `lm` output object:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# fit the model\nmod_pressure<-lm(bp~pres, data=forbes)\n\n# plot fitted values and residuals\nplot(mod_pressure$fitted, mod_pressure$residual, \n     xlab=\"Fitted Value\", ylab=\"Residual\", pch=16)\n\n# add horizontal reference line\nabline(h=0, col=2, lwd=3)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Homoskedasticity\n\nNot only do you want your model to consistently have an average residual of zero, you want the spread around zero to be the same across all values of X. The term for this idea of same spread is ***homoskedasticity***.\n\nConsider the `cpus` data frame in the MASS library of R. This data includes a variety of performance measures and characteristics of CPUs (computer Central Processing Units). The left side of @fig-cpus shows a plot of the estimated CPU performance based on a prediction model by Ein-Dor and Feldmesser and the published performance based on an industry benchmark. Part b of @fig-cpus shows the fitted vs. residual plot for the fitted model predicting published performance based on the Ein-Dor/Feldmesser estimate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-cpus .cell layout-ncol=\"3\" layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Data with fit](Chapter4_files/figure-pdf/fig-cpus-1.pdf){#fig-cpus-1 fig-align='center'}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Fitted vs. Residuals](Chapter4_files/figure-pdf/fig-cpus-2.pdf){#fig-cpus-2 fig-align='center'}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Log(Fitted) vs. Residuals](Chapter4_files/figure-pdf/fig-cpus-3.pdf){#fig-cpus-3 fig-align='center'}\n:::\n\nCPU Model and Residuals\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis fitted vs. residual plot doesn't show curvature like we saw with the boiling point data, but it doesn't exactly look like a random cloud either. @fig-cpus c stretches out the x-axis using a log scale so you can better picture what is going on with the residuals as we move from low performing to high performing CPUs. The CPUs on the lower end of our scale with log fitted performance below 2.0 have residuals with a noticeably tighter clump around zero than the more powerful CPUs with log fitted performance above 2.0.\n\nRecall from the inference equations in Chapter 3, a single $S_R$ is used to represent the variability of residuals throughout the model. If $S_R$ is not constant, those inference equations are no longer valid.\n\nBeyond evaluating constant variance with a fitted vs. residual scatterplot, there is also a formal hypothesis test you can perform to check if the homoskedasticity assumption is reasonable. The F-test considers the null hypothesis that the ratio of two variances is equal to 1, vs the alternative that the ratio is different from 1. The test statistic is simply:\n\n$$\nF=\\frac{\\sigma^2_1}{\\sigma^2_2}\n$$ where $\\sigma^2_1$ is the variance from group 1, and $\\sigma^2_2$ is the variance of the second group. The degrees of freedom for the test are $n_1-1$ and $n_2-1$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the two group sample sizes.\n\nPerforming this test on the CPU performance data and splitting the data so group 1 includes fitted values \\<50 and group 2 has fitted values \\<=50 yields:\n\n$$\nF=\\frac{166.859}{3098.414}=0.05385\n$$\n\nwith $100-1=99$ and $109-1=108$ degrees of freedom. As shown below this means the p-value for the test is very very small meaning there is strong evidence the ratio of variances is not 1 and homoskedasticity is not present. The opposite of homoskedasticity is heteroskedasticity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Chapter4_files/figure-pdf/Figure 4-1.pdf){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### In R {.unnumbered}\n\nThe new element here is the variance test. R makes this easy to do with the `var.test` function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmod_cpu<-lm(perf~estperf, data=cpus)\n\ngroup<-mod_cpu$fitted<50\n\nvar.test(mod_cpu$residuals[group==TRUE], mod_cpu$residuals[group==FALSE])\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Normality\n\nThinking back to the inference procedures of Chapter 3, recall that the t-distribution plays a role. That is because it is assumed that the residuals are approximately Normally distributed. Looking again at the cat heart weight and body weight data and model, @fig-normhist shows the fitted model, the fitted vs. residual plot, and a histogram of the model residuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-normhist .cell layout-ncol=\"3\" layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Data with fit](Chapter4_files/figure-pdf/fig-normhist-1.pdf){#fig-normhist-1 fig-align='center'}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Fitted vs. Residuals](Chapter4_files/figure-pdf/fig-normhist-2.pdf){#fig-normhist-2 fig-align='center'}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Residual Hisogram](Chapter4_files/figure-pdf/fig-normhist-3.pdf){#fig-normhist-3 fig-align='center'}\n:::\n\nCat model and residuals\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA line looks like a reasonable approach looking at the random scatter of the fitted vs. residual plot, and there isn't cause to suspect heteroskedasticiy either (an F-test comparing the variance of the first 50% of fitted values to the second 50% of values has a p-value of 0.1012 ). The histogram of residuals looks fairly Normal, but there's more to do to check.\n\nFirst is a residual Quantile-Quantile plot, usually simply referred to as a QQ plot. This plot is a scatterplot looking at the quantiles of your residuals as observed vs the quantiles you would have if your data was perfectly normally distributed. @fig-qqplot shows three example QQ plots for three different distributions shapes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-qqplot .cell layout-ncol=\"3\" layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Normal](Chapter4_files/figure-pdf/fig-qqplot-1.pdf){#fig-qqplot-1 fig-align='center'}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Uniform](Chapter4_files/figure-pdf/fig-qqplot-2.pdf){#fig-qqplot-2 fig-align='center'}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Skewed](Chapter4_files/figure-pdf/fig-qqplot-3.pdf){#fig-qqplot-3 fig-align='center'}\n:::\n\nThree QQ-Plot examples\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a), you see the ideal case where the data and the theoretical Normal align and follow the red reference line. @fig-qqplot b) shows what your QQ plot will look like if your residuals are distributed in a way that has more weight on both tails than is expected with a Normal. Along the middle of 6B the reference line is fairly closely followed, but left side is above the line and the right side is below the line. On the far right, @fig-qqplot c shows what a QQ plot looks like with right-skewed data. The right-skew makes for points in the QQ plot that stretch high above the reference line on the right side of the plot. If left-skewed, the plot would show a trail of points far below the line on the left side.\n\nIn the case of the cat data, the QQ plot of the residuals is as shown in Figure 7. Though not perfect, the points follow the reference line fairly well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Cat Model Residuals](Chapter4_files/figure-pdf/fig-catqq-1.pdf){#fig-catqq fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA formal test of Normality can be performed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Details of how the test works are beyond our scope here, but the execution of the test is easy with software such as R. The null hypothesis in the Shapiro-Wilk test is that the sample data comes from a Normal distribution. Therefore, if the Shapiro-Wilk p-value is small, that indicates the Null is likely false, and therefore your assumption about Normal residuals is likely false. In our cat model, the Shapiro-Wilk test on the residuals yields a p-value of 0.1046, supporting our conclusion that assuming Normality is reasonable based on the histogram and QQ plots.\n\n### In R {.unnumbered}\n\nQQ plots require two lines of code to create the visualization. The first line makes the scatterplot and the second overlays the reference line. The `col` and `lwd` options in the `qqline` function are optional, but can be helpful to make your reference line stand out a bit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqqnorm(mod_cat$residuals)\nqqline(mod_cat$residuals, col=2, lwd=3)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Shapiro-Wilk test for Normality is even easier to execute in R than the F test for homoskedasticity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nshapiro.test(mod_cat$residuals)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Independence\n\nThe final big assumption that was made in fitter the regression model is related to independence. Does each point in your scatterplot represent an observation that is independent from all the others?\n\nOften this is an assumption that requires little more than pausing to think about how the data was collected. Does each point come from a different cat/cpu/person/car... whatever your study subject is? That's a good indication you are working with independent data. One plot that is often worthwhile when considering independence is simply a look at your residuals in order from first collected to last collected.\n\nLike a good fitted vs. residual plot, a plot of residuals ordered by collection time should be a random scatter centered at zero. If, however, your data collector got better at their job over time, or equipment changed as it was used, or experimental conditions changed in a way you weren't aware of, or... some other weirdness... you might see a pattern or drift in the plot indicating a lack of independence.\n\n@fig-dw shows the residuals from a)the CPU performance model b) the model predicting blood alcohol level based on beer consumption from Chapter 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-dw .cell layout-ncol=\"2\" layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![BAC Residuals](Chapter4_files/figure-pdf/fig-dw-1.pdf){#fig-dw-1 fig-align='center' fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![CPU Residuals](Chapter4_files/figure-pdf/fig-dw-2.pdf){#fig-dw-2 fig-align='center' fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n\nResiduals in order\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot of BAC residuals might look like it has a hint of a downward slope, but much of that is caused by students 1 and 3 having two of three largest residuals. If point 3 was removed, your eye wouldn't question this as a random jumble and we're looking for patterns stronger than a single point's influence.\n\nThe CPU residuals look random at first glance, but on a closer inspection you'll notice that there seem to be some clumping behavior. For example right around the index of 100, there are six points all together with unusually large residuals. Later on around 155, there's a clump of more than 10 points largely on top of each other forming a downward sloping tightly knit cluster.\n\nThankfully you need not rely on your eyes catching deviations from random scatter to properly assess independence; a formal test for correlated residuals exists. The Durbin-Watson test has the null hypothesis that the correlation of successive residuals (known as the autocorrelation of residuals) is zero against the alternative that it is non-zero. This means that small p-values from the Durbin-Watson test indicate the assumption of independence may not be valid.\n\nThe p-value for the Durbin-Watson test applied to the BAC model is 0.6152 and for the CPU model the Durbin-Watson p-value is \\ensuremath{10^{-4}}. This indicates that while our independence assumption for the student blood alcohol level data is likely sound, the same assumption for the CPU data is in doubt.\n\nWhy might that be? It seems unlikely that one published CPU performance compared to estimated performance would influence another one. The problem lies in our data's ordering. The CPU data frame is not listed in the order of measurement, but rather is listed by alphabetical order of the CPU name. What's happening here is that the performance estimate does a better job on CPUs from some manufacturers than others and so the errors turn up in clusters based on maker. Just because your Durbin-Watson test indicates significant autocorrelation doesn't mean trouble - it just means there is structure to your data order you maybe weren't aware of.\n\n### In R {.unnumbered}\n\nThe plot of residuals from first to last is a simple `plot` command. The Durbin-Watson test is available in the `lmtest` library in R and takes in a lm model object as the key input. Note that putting your residuals into the `dwtest` function won't work - you need to input the model object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# fit the model\nmod_bac<-lm(bac~beers, data=bac)\n\n# plot the residuals, add in a reference line if you like\nplot(mod_bac$residuals)\nabline(h=0, col=2, lwd=3)\n\n# load the lmtest library\nlibrary(lmtest)\n\n# run the Durbin-Watson test\ndwtest(mod_bac)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## All Assumptions, On Your Own {.unnumbered}\n\nNothing says your model can only break one assumption at a time.
