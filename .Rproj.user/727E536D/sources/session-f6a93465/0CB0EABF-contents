# write a text book section explaining the concept of leverage in multiple regression

Leverage in multiple regression quantifies how far an observation’s predictor values are from the mean of all predictors in a dataset, indicating the potential for that data point to strongly influence the estimated regression coefficients and model fit.[^write-a-text-book-section-explaining-the-concept-o-1][^write-a-text-book-section-explaining-the-concept-o-2][^write-a-text-book-section-explaining-the-concept-o-3]

### Definition and Calculation

Leverage is commonly measured using the diagonal elements of the "hat matrix" ($\mathbf{H}$), which projects observed response values onto fitted values in regression. For observation $i$, the leverage score ($h_{ii}$) reflects the impact that point's $x$-values have on its predicted value, and is given by:[^write-a-text-book-section-explaining-the-concept-o-4][^write-a-text-book-section-explaining-the-concept-o-5]

[^write-a-text-book-section-explaining-the-concept-o-5]: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage\_(statistics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(statistics)){.uri}

$$
h_{ii} = \mathbf{x}_i^T (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1} \mathbf{x}_i
$$

where $\mathbf{X}$ is the matrix of predictor variables and $\mathbf{x}_i$ is the vector of predictors for observation $i$. In simple linear regression, leverage for each point can be calculated analytically, but in multiple regression, leverage requires matrix computations. The average leverage across all cases is $p/n$, where $p$ is the number of predictors plus one (for the intercept) and $n$ is the sample size.[^write-a-text-book-section-explaining-the-concept-o-6][^write-a-text-book-section-explaining-the-concept-o-7][^write-a-text-book-section-explaining-the-concept-o-8]

### Interpretation and Guidelines

High leverage does not necessarily mean a point is influential—it indicates "potential" for influence on the regression results. Typically, leverage values above $2p/n$ or much higher than the average are flagged for review. High-leverage points have predictor values far from the mean, which means the regression line will often be pulled toward them. However, if their response value aligns well with the model, they may not affect coefficients much, distinguishing high leverage from true influence.[^write-a-text-book-section-explaining-the-concept-o-9][^write-a-text-book-section-explaining-the-concept-o-10][^write-a-text-book-section-explaining-the-concept-o-11][^write-a-text-book-section-explaining-the-concept-o-12][^write-a-text-book-section-explaining-the-concept-o-13][^write-a-text-book-section-explaining-the-concept-o-14]

### Diagnostic Use and Examples

Leverage diagnostics help identify observations that could disproportionately shape the model. For example, if most data points cluster around moderate values of predictors and one point has an extreme value (e.g., much larger or smaller), that point has high leverage. In practical regression diagnostics, plots such as "residuals vs leverage," possibly with contours for influential measures (like Cook’s Distance), visualize both a point’s leverage and its real-world impact on the model.[^write-a-text-book-section-explaining-the-concept-o-15][^write-a-text-book-section-explaining-the-concept-o-16][^write-a-text-book-section-explaining-the-concept-o-17][^write-a-text-book-section-explaining-the-concept-o-18]

### Distinction from Outliers and Influence

-   **Outliers:** Points with large residuals (unusual $y$-values).
-   **Leverage Points:** Points with unusual $x$-values.
-   **Influential Points:** Points that, if removed, would change the model coefficients significantly.

Not all outliers or leverage points are influential—but influence requires a combination of high leverage and a large residual.[^write-a-text-book-section-explaining-the-concept-o-19][^write-a-text-book-section-explaining-the-concept-o-20]
